Hi there. My name is Samuel Akinwusi. I design and develop web applications. I am currently based in Atlanta, GA. And recently graduated from <a href="https://ccse.kennesaw.edu/cs/">Kennesaw State University</a>. I have been working with Swordcon solutions for the past year where I get to develop applications and work on projects.
